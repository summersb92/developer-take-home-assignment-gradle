Welcome to the Cappex developer take home test. You will be setting up
a development environment and writing a small web application as part of this
take home test. The environment setup instructions, environment_setup_instructions.txt, 
and web application requirements, web_application_requirements.txt, can both be 
found within the same directory as this file.

If you have any questions about the setup or requirements, please email 
jpark@cappex.com and mkruger@cappex.com and one of them will be happy to assist you.

Also, if you discover any issues with our documentation or base web application,
please don't hesitate to let us know. We are always looking for ways to improve.

Have fun and we look forward to reviewing your work. 

Sincerely,
The Cappex Technology Team
