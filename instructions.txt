Welcome to the Cappex developer take home exercise. The goal of this exercise is
for you to code review an existing application and provice constructive
criticism to the author. As part of the code review we would like you to have
an understanding of the requirements and the ability to use the application.
Please read through the requirements detailed within the
web_application_requirements.txt file and instructions for executing the
application can be found within the environment_setup_instructions.txt file. For
the code review, we would like you to provide code review comments for the following
categories and anything else that you feel is appropriate:
1. Java code
2. SQL code
3. JSP code
4. CSS code
5. Javascript code
6. Uses architecture/patterns/packaging appropriately
7. Visually appealing

If you have any questions about the setup, requirements, or code review, please
email jpark@cappex.com and mkruger@cappex.com and one of them will be happy to
assist you.

Also, if you discover any issues with our documentation or setup,
please don't hesitate to let us know. We are always looking for ways to improve.

Have fun and we look forward to reviewing your work.

Sincerely,
The Cappex Technology Team
