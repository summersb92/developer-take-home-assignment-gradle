# developer-take-home-assignment

This is the Cappex developer take-home assignment and the initial version was created in March, 2015 by Junho Park and Mike Kruger.

Please note the following:

1. The original version of this project was a Maven project that was created using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition Version 14.  This current version is a Gradle project and works perfectly fine without using a full-fledged IDE (But IDEs such as Eclips or IntelliJ IDEA can be used and has been tested).

2. If you're a Software Engineer candidate, please take a look at the following files instead:

* instructions.txt
* environment_setup.txt
* web_application_requirements.txt
